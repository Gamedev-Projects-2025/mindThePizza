Main objects:

The chef – helps the player to make the pizza if the player gets stuck.

We have chosen the values such that the game’s difficulty would change depending on the skill level of the patient in order to challenge them to complete harder objectives whilst not making it impossible for them to complete said objectives.



Locations:

The pizzeria – The main place where the game takes place. This is where the player makes the pizzas and serves customers.

The statistics screen – At the end of each session, the player will be shown a screen with the statistics of their performance in order to gauge their performance.



Behavior:

The chef helps the player depending on the amount of mistakes and the time it takes for the player to figure out the game. They start off by giving the player small clues about the location of ingredients and instructions, and if they see that the player is having a difficult time, they’ll point him to the right direction with visual stimulation such as arrows and lights.



Economy:

No economy is planned for the game.



Information:

Information about the game is given in the tutorial level, in hints given by the chef, and in the recipes that appear on screen for each order. The player is given just enough information to operate the game and to learn on their own.



Choices:

The pizza making process is in real time, the more time the player spends on a single pizza, the more the chef is going to help the player.



Strategy:

There is no real strategy, the player need only to complete the objectives as quickly as possible and with as few mistakes as possible.
